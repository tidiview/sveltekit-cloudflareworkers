Does not exist in the Hebrew text)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_engendre\" title=\"I gave you my breast before dawn\" id=\"engendre\" class=\"green\">«I gave you my breast before dawn.»</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">This son, who was born before centuries, has sent him over the last centuries into the world as healer, as your prophet (Psalms Book, <abbr title=\"fifty-seven\">CVII</abbr> <span style=\"color: #999\">(Vulgate CVI, 20)</span> declares:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_verbe\" title=\"Il a envoyé son Verbe et il les a guéris\" id=\"verbe\" class=\"green\">«He sent his Word and cured them.»</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">As claiming as you do that he cannot generate himself;</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Listen to your prophet speak under the dictation of the Lord <span style=\"color: #999\">(Isaiah, <abbr title=\"sixty six\">LXVI</abbr>, 9. The interpretation of the biblical text by Gregory of Tours is questionable.)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_enfanter\" title=\"Why could not I, who make the others give birth, also give birth?\" id=\"enfanter\" class=\"green\">«Why could not I, who make the others give birth, also give birth?»</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">These words he said them about the people who reborn in him by faith.</p>\n<p>To that the Jew replied:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«How could God become a man, be born of a woman, be exposed to beatings and sentenced to death?».</p>\n<p>On what the king keeping quiet, I interposed in the middle of them and said:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«If God, the son of God, has made himself human the cause of it has been not in his need, but in ours, for he could not redeem the captive man from sin and reduced by the devil to slavery only by taking human nature.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">It is by taking testimonies not to the gospels, nor to the apostle to whom you do not believe, but to your books that I will pierce you with the tip of your own sword as one tells David once did when he slit Goliath's throat.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Therefore listen to your prophet saying that God had to become a man <span style=\"color: #999\">(R. Buchner (Zehn Bacher Geschichten, II, p. 10, note 1)</span>, bring this allusion to a Jeremie <span style=\"color: #999\">(<abbr title=\"seventeen\">XVII</abbr>, verse 9)</span>, that Gregory borrowed from a text other than that of the Vulgate:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_ecoute\" title=\"Dieu devait devenir homme\" id=\"ecoute\" class=\"green\">«He is both God and man, and who knew him?»</a>.</p>\n<p>He said elsewhere <span style=\"color: #999\">(Baruch, <abbr title=\"three\">III</abbr>, verses 36 to 38)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_luinotredieu\" title=\"He is the one who is our God\" id=\"luinotredieu\" class=\"green\">«He is the one who is our God, and we will not recognize any other than him;»</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_luinotredieu\" title=\"He is the one who is our God\" class=\"green\">He found the whole path of science and gave it to Jacob his servant and to Israel his beloved.</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_luinotredieu\" title=\"He is the one who is our God\" class=\"green\">After that he appeared on the earth and he talked with the men.</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">As for his birth from a virgin, listen also to what your prophet <span style=\"color: #999\">(Isaie, VII, 14 says. This verse was reproduced by St. Matthiew (chapter <abbr title=\"one\">I</abbr>, verses 23 and 24), which completes the text of the prophete with words: «That is God with us»)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_vierge\" title=ow a virgin will conceive in her womb\" id=\"vierge\" class=\"green\">«Now a virgin will conceive in her womb and she will bring a son and he will be called Emmanuel, which means: God with us».</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">With regard to the beatings he had to suffer, nails that he had been punctured and other outrages that he had to endure and were inflicted upon him, another prophet who spoke about it <span style=\"color: #999\">(Psalms, <abbr title=\"twenty two\">XXII</abbr>, verses 17, 19)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_perce\" title=\"Ils ont percé mes mains et mes pieds; ils ont partagé entre eux mes vêtements\" id=\"perce\" class=\"green\">«They pierced my hands and feet; they shared my clothes with each other etc… »</a>\nAnd he says further <span style=\"color: #999\">(Psalmes, <abbr title=\"sixty nine\">LXIX</abbr>, 22.)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_fiel\" title=\"They gave me fiel and in my thirst they watered me with vinegar\" id=\"fiel\" class=\"green\">«They gave me fiel and in my thirst they watered me with vinegar»</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">And it was the same David who said that he brought in his kingdom by the very gibbet of the cross the fallen world and subjected to the devil's domination:\n<a href=\"#note_parlebois\" title=\"The Lord reigned by wood\" id=\"parlebois\" class=\"green\">«The Lord, he said <span style=\"color: #999\">(according to Buchner, </abbr title=\"opus citatum\">op.

Vulgate)</span>.</a></p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Not that he did not rule before the Father, but he received a new kingdom to reign on the people he had issued from the slavery of the devil».</p>\n<p>To that the Jew replied:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«What need God had to suffer all these things?».</p>\n<p>I told him:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«I have already told you that God has created the innocent man, but that he, circled by the ruse of the snake, disobeyed the precept;</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">And that's why hunted from the rest of heaven, he was handed over to the sorrow of this world;</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">but by the death of Christ, the only son of God, he was reconciled with God the Father».</p>\n<p>The Jew says:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«God could not send prophets or apostles to bring him back into the path of salvation without humiliating himself by incarnating himself».</p>\n<p>To that I replied:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">«From the beginning the human race has always sinned without ever having frightened nor by the flood of the deluge, the fire of Sodom, neither the wounds of Egypt nor the miraculous division of the waters of the sea and the Jordan, he has always resisted God's law, and not just he didn't believe, but still he killed those who were preaching penance.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Also if he had not come down himself to buy back, no other could have done so.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Born again thanks to his nativity, washed by baptism, healed by his wound, recovered by his resurrection, we were glorified by his ascension.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Moreover, it was your prophet who said that he would come to remedy our diseases <span style=\"color: #999\">(Isaiah, <abbr title=\"fifty three\">LIII</abbr>, 5)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_meurtrissure\" title=\"Nous avons été guéris par sa meurtrissure\" id=\"meurtrissure\" class=\"green\">«We have been cured by his brutality»</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">And elsewhere he says <span style=\"color: #999\">(Isaiah, <abbr title=\"fifty three\">LIII</abbr>, 7)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_commeunebrebis\" title=\"Like a sheep it has been led to the killing\" id=\"commeunebrebis\" class=\"green\">«Like a sheep it has been led to the killing and\neven if a lamb remains silent in front of the one who taps it, he has not opened his mouth»</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">It was in humiliation that his conviction was torn.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">Who told his origin?</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_armees\" title=\"Seigneur des armées est son nom\" id=\"armees\" class=\"green\">«Lord of Armies is his name <span style=\"color: #999\">(Isaiah, <abbr title=\"fifty four\">LIV</abbr>, 4)</span>»</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">It is from him that this Jacob of whom you are wandering to\ncome from said by blessing his son Judas as if he spoke of Christ himself, son of God (Gregory of Tours is inspired in his replica of Genese <span style=\"color: #999\">(<abbr title=\"forty nine\">XLIX</abbr>, verses 8 to 12 without literally reproducing the text)</span>:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\"><a href=\"#note_lionceau\" title=\"Your father's sons will
