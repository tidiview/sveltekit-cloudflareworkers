Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.</li>\n  <li>Now we must try to tell why a <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">living being</span> is called <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">mortal</span> or <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">immortal</span>.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"246c\"><span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">Soul</span>, considered collectively, has the care of all that which is <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soulless</span>,</li>\n  <li>and it traverses the whole heaven, appearing sometimes in one form and sometimes in another;</li>\n  <li>now when it is perfect and fully <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">winged</span>, it mounts upward and governs the whole world;</li>\n  <li>but the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> which has lost its <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wings</span> is borne along until it gets hold of something solid,</li>\n  <li>when it settles down,</li>\n  <li>taking upon itself an earthly <span style=\"color:#13aadd;\">body</span>, which seems to be self-moving, because of the power of the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> within it;</li>\n  <li>and the whole, compounded of <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> and <span style=\"color:#13aadd;\">body</span>, is called a living being, and is further designated as mortal.</li>\n  <li>It is not immortal by any reasonable supposition,</li>\n  <li>but we, though we have never seen or rightly conceived a god,</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"246d\">imagine an immortal being which has both a <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> and a <span style=\"color:#13aadd;\">body</span> which are united for all time.</li>\n  <li>Let that, however, and our words concerning it, be as is pleasing to God;</li>\n  <li>we will now consider the reason why the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> loses its <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wings</span>.</li>\n  <li>It is something like this.</li>\n  <li>The natural function of the <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wing</span> is to soar upwards and carry that which is heavy up to the place where dwells the race of the gods.</li>\n  <li>More than any other thing that pertains to the <span style=\"color:#13aadd;\">body</span> it partakes of the nature of the divine.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"246e\">But the divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and all such qualities;</li>\n  <li>by these then the <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wings</span> of the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> are nourished and grow, but by the opposite qualities,</li>\n  <li>such as vileness and evil, they are wasted away and destroyed.</li>\n  <li>Now the great leader in heaven, Zeus, driving a <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">winged</span> chariot,</li>\n  <li>goes first, arranging all things and caring for all things.</li>\n  <li>He is followed by an army of gods and spirits, arrayed in eleven squadrons;</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"247a\">Hestia alone remains in the house of the gods.</li>\n  <li>Of the rest, those who are included among the twelve great gods and are accounted leaders, are assigned each to his place in the army.</li>\n  <li>There are many blessed sights and many ways hither and thither within the heaven,</li>\n  <li>along which the blessed gods go to and fro attending each to his own duties;</li>\n  <li>and whoever wishes, and is able, follows,</li>\n  <li>for jealousy is excluded from the celestial band.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"247b\">But when they go to a feast and a banquet,</li>\n  <li>they proceed steeply upward to the top of the vault of heaven,</li>\n  <li>where the chariots of the gods, whose well matched horses obey the rein, advance easily,</li>\n  <li>but the others with difficulty;</li>\n  <li>for the horse of evil nature</li>\n  <li>weighs the chariot down, making it heavy and pulling toward the earth the charioteer whose horse is not well trained.</li>\n  <li>There the utmost toil and struggle await the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span>.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"247c\">For those that are called immortal, when they reach the top, pass outside</li>\n  <li>and take their place on the outer surface of the heaven,</li>\n  <li>and when they have taken their stand, the revolution carries them round</li>\n  <li>and they behold the things outside of the heaven.</li>\n  <li>But the region above the heaven was never worthily sung by any earthly poet, nor will it ever be.</li>\n  <li>It is, however, as I shall tell; for I must dare to speak the truth,</li>\n  <li>especially as truth is my theme.</li>\n  <li>For the colorless, formless, and intangible truly existing essence, with which all true knowledge is concerned, holds this region and is visible only to the mind, the pilot of the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span>.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"247d\">Now the divine intelligence, since it is nurtured on mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> which is capable of receiving that which befits it, rejoices in seeing reality for a space of time and by gazing upon truth is nourished and made happy until the revolution brings it again to the same place.</li>\n  <li>In the revolution it beholds absolute justice, temperance, and knowledge, not such knowledge as has a beginning and varies as it is associated with one or another of the things we call realities, but that which abides in the real eternal absolute;</li>\n  <li>and in the same way it beholds and feeds upon the other eternal verities, after which, passing down again within the heaven, it goes home,</li>\n  <li>and there the charioteer puts up the horses at the manger and feeds them with ambrosia and then gives them nectar to drink.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"248a\">«Such is the life of the gods;</li>\n  <li>but of the other <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">souls</span>,</li>\n  <li>that which best follows after God and is most like him, raises the head of the charioteer up into the outer region and is carried round in the revolution,</li>\n  <li>troubled by the horses and hardly beholding the realities;</li>\n  <li>and another sometimes rises</li>\n  <li>and sometimes sinks,</li>\n  <li>and, because its horses are unruly,</li>\n  <li>it sees some things</li>\n  <li>and fails to see others.</li>\n  <li>The other <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">souls</span> follow after, all yearning for the upper region but unable to reach it, and are carried round beneath,</li>\n  <li>trampling upon and colliding with one another, each striving to pass its neighbor.</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"248b\">So there is the greatest confusion and sweat of rivalry, wherein many are lamed, and many <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wings</span> are broken through the incompetence of the drivers;</li>\n  <li>and after much toil they all go away without gaining a view of reality,</li>\n  <li>and when they have gone away they feed upon opinion.</li>\n  <li>But the reason of the great eagerness to see where the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">«plain of truth»</span> is,</li>\n  <tr>\n  <li id=\"248c\">lies in the fact that the fitting pasturage for the best part of the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</span> is in the meadow there, and the <span style=\"color:#a4660e;\">wing</span> on which the <span style=\"color:#df8a13;\">soul</li>\n</ol>\n\n<footer>\n  <p><span style=\"color: #df8a13;\">Plato, <cite>Phaedrus</cite>, paragraphs 246a to 248c</span></p>\n  <p><time datetime=\"P5M30\">5 min. 30''</time></p>\n</footer>\n</article>",
