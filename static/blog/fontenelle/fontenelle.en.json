But revealing the \"Opera machines\" is also to desacralize the universe and demystify an earlier textuality (Aristotle, Plato...).</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Excerpt from the first chapter: «first evening»</h2>\n\n<p>Thus true philosophers spend their lives not believing what they see, and trying to guess what they do not see, and this condition is not, it seems to me, too much to envy.</p>\n<p>On this I always figure that nature is a great show that resembles that of the <a id=\"renvoi-opera\" href=\"#opera\" title=\"#opera\">Opera</a>.</p>\n<p>From where you are at the Opera House, you do not see the theatre quite as it is; the decorations and machines have been arranged to make a pleasant effect from a distance, and these wheels and counterweights that make all the movements are hidden from your view.</p>\n<p>So don't be embarrassed to guess how all this works.</p>\n<p>There may be only a few machinists hidden in the <a id=\"renvoi-parterre\" href=\"#parterre\" title=\"#parterre\">parterre</a>, who are worried about a theft that will have seemed extraordinary to him and who absolutely wants to untangle how this flight was carried out.</p>\n<p>You can see that this machinist is quite made like philosophers.</p>\n<p>But what makes it more difficult for philosophers is that in the machines that nature presents to us, the strings are perfectly well hidden, and they are so well hidden that we have long been guessing what caused the movements of the universe.</p>\n<p>For do you represent all the wise men at the Opera, the Pythagoras, the Plato, the Aristotle, and all those people whose names now make so much noise to our ears; suppose they saw the theft of <a id=\"renvoi-phaeton\" href=\"#phaeton\" title=\"#phaeton\">Phaeton</a> that the winds remove, that they could not discover the strings, and that they did not know how the back of the theatre was arranged.</p>\n<p>One of them said: \"It is a certain secret virtue that takes Phaeton away\".</p>\n<p>The other:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">\"Phaeton is composed of certain numbers that make it rise\".</p>\n<p>The other:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">\"Phaeton has a certain friendship for the top of the theatre; he is not at ease when he is not there\".</p>\n<p>The other:</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">\"Phaeton is not made to fly, but he prefers to fly, than to leave the top of the theatre empty? and a hundred other dreams that I am surprised that have not lost their reputation all over Antiquity.</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">At the end Descartes, and some other modern ones came, who said: \"Phaeton goes up, because he is pulled by ropes, and a heavier weight than he goes down\".</p>\n<p>Thus we no longer believe that a body moves, if it is not pulled, or rather pushed by another body; we no longer believe that it rises or falls, if not by the effect of a counterweight or a spring; and whoever sees nature as it is, would only see the back of the opera theatre.</p>\n<p>In this respect, says the Marquise, philosophy has become quite mechanical? So mechanical, I replied, that I fear that we will soon be ashamed of it.</p>\n<p>We want the universe to be large, only what a watch is small, and everything to be driven by regulated movements that depend on the arrangement of the parts.</p>\n<p>Admit the truth.</p>\n<p>Have you not sometimes had a more sublime idea of the universe, and have you not done him more honor than he deserved?</p>\n<p>I've seen people who didn't think so much of him since they met him.</p>\n<p>And she replied, \"I think much more of her, since I know it looks like a watch.</p>\n<p>It is surprising that the order of nature, however admirable it may be, only runs on such simple things\".</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <h3 class=\"yellow\">Notes:</h3>\n\n  <h4 id=\"opera\" class=\"yellow note\">Opera</h4>\n  <p>Opera:  proper name designating the Paris Opera, founded in <time datetime=\"1669\">1669</time>.</p>\n  <footer>\n    <p class=\"puce\"><a href=\"#renvoi-opera\" title=\"#renvoi-opera\">back to text ↩</a></p>\n  </footer>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"parterre\" class=\"yellow note\">Parterre</h4>\n  <p>Parterre: Ground floor of a theatre where the audience was standing and where the seats were cheaper than in the dressing rooms.</p>\n  <footer>\n    <p class=\"puce\"><a href=\"#renvoi-parterre\" title=\"#renvoi-parterre\">back to text ↩</a></p>\n  </footer>\n\n  <h4 id=\"phaeton\" class=\"yellow note\">Lulli's <cite>Phaeton</cite></h4>\n  <p><cite>Phaeton</cite>, Quinault's lyrical tragedy in five acts, Lulli's music created at the Opera in <time datetime=\"1683\">1683</time>, and whose success was considerable.
