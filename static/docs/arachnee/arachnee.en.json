and she approved</li>\n  <li>their songs and their resentment; but her heart</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>was brooding thus,</p></li>\n    <li><p class=\"conversation\">“It is an easy thing</p></li>\n    <li><p class=\"conversation\">to praise another, I should do as they:</p>\n    <li><p class=\"conversation\">no creature of the earth should ever slight</p>\n    <li><p class=\"conversation\">the majesty that dwells in me,—without</p>\n      <li><p class=\"conversation\">just retribution.”</p>\n    <p>—So her thought was turned</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>upon the fortune of <mark>Arachne</mark> — proud,</li>\n  <li>who would not ever yield to her the praise</li>\n  <li>won by the art of deftly weaving wool,</li>\n  <li>a girl who had not fame for place of birth,</li>\n  <li>nor fame for birth, but only fame for skill!</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">For it was well known that her father dwelt</li>\n  <li>in Colophon; where, at his humble trade,</li>\n  <li>he dyed in Phocean purples, fleecy wool.</li>\n  <li>Her mother, also of the lower class,</li>\n  <li>had died. <mark>Arachne</mark> in a mountain town</li>\n  <li>by skill had grown so famous in the Land</li>\n  <li>of Lydia, that unnumbered curious nymphs</li>\n  <li>eager to witness her dexterity,</li>\n  <li>deserted the lush vineyards of Timolus;</li>\n  <li>or even left the cool and flowing streams</li>\n  <li>of bright Pactolus, to admire the cloth,</li>\n  <li>or to observe her deftly spinning wool.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">So graceful was her motion then,—if she</li>\n  <li>was twisting the coarse wool in little balls,</li>\n  <li>or if she teased it with her finger-tips,</li>\n  <li>or if she softened the fine fleece, drawn forth</li>\n  <li>in misty films, or if she twirled the smooth</li>\n  <li>round spindle with her energetic thumb,</li>\n  <li>or if with needle she embroidered cloth;—</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">in all her motions one might well perceive</li>\n  <li>how much <mark>Minerva</mark> had instructed her:</li>\n  <li>but this she ever would deny, displeased</li>\n  <li>to share her fame; and said,\n    <p class=\"conversation\">“Let her contend</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">in art with me; and if her skill prevails,</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">I then will forfeit all!”</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\"><mark>Minerva</mark> heard,</li>\n  <li>and came to her, disguised with long grey hair,</li>\n  <li>and with a staff to steady her weak limbs.</li>\n  <li>She seemed a feeble woman, very old,</li>\n  <li>and quavered as she said,\n    <p class=\"conversation\">“Old age is not</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">the cause of every ill; experience comes</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">with lengthened years; and, therefore, you should not</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">despise my words. It is no harm in you</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">to long for praise of mortals, when</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">your nimble hands are spinning the soft wool,—</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">but you should not deny <mark>Minerva</mark>'s art—</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">and you should pray that she may pardon you,</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">for she will grant you pardon if you ask.”</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\"><mark>Arachne</mark>, scowling with an evil face.</li>\n  <li>Looked at the goddess, as she dropped her thread.</li>\n  <li>She hardly could restrain her threatening hand,</li>\n  <li>and, trembling in her anger, she replied</li>\n  <li>to you, disguised <mark>Minerva</mark>:</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">\n    <p class=\"conversation\">“Silly fool,—</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">worn out and witless in your palsied age,</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">a great age is your great misfortune!— Let</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">your daughter and your son's wife—if the Gods</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">have blessed you—let them profit by your words;</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">within myself, my knowledge is contained</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">sufficient; you need not believe that your</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">advice does any good; for I am quite</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">unchanged in my opinion. Get you gone,—</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">advise your goddess to come here herself,</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">and not avoid the contest!”</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">Instantly,</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the goddess said,</p>\n    <p class=\"conversation\">“<mark>Minerva</mark> comes to you!”</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>And with those brief words, put aside the shape</li>\n  <li>of the old woman, and revealed herself,</li>\n  <li><mark>Minerva</mark>, goddess.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">All the other Nymphs</li>\n  <li>and matrons of Mygdonia worshiped her;</li>\n  <li>but not <mark>Arachne</mark>, who defiant stood;—</li>\n  <li>although at first she flushed up—then went pale—</li>\n  <li>then blushed again, reluctant.—So, at first,</li>\n  <li>the sky suffuses, as Aurora moves,</li>\n  <li>and, quickly when the glorious sun comes up,</li>\n  <li>pales into white.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">She even rushed upon</li>\n  <li>her own destruction, for she would not give</li>\n  <li>from her desire to gain the victory.</li>\n  <li>Nor did the daughter of almighty Jove</li>\n  <li>decline: disdaining to delay with words,</li>\n  <li>she hesitated not.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And both, at once,</li>\n  <li>selected their positions, stretched their webs</li>\n  <li>with finest warp, and separated warp with sley.</li>\n  <li>The woof was next inserted in the web</li>\n  <li>by means of the sharp shuttles, which</li>\n  <li>their nimble fingers pushed along, so drawn</li>\n  <li>within the warp, and so the teeth notched in</li>\n  <li>the moving sley might strike them.—Both, in haste,</li>\n  <li>girded their garments to their breasts and moved</li>\n  <li>their skilful arms, beguiling their fatigue</li>\n  <li>in eager action.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">Myriad tints appeared</li>\n  <li>besides the Tyrian purple—royal dye,</li>\n  <li>extracted in brass vessels.—As the bow,</li>\n  <li>that spans new glory in the curving sky,</li>\n  <li>its glittering rays reflected in the rain,</li>\n  <li>spreads out a multitude of blended tints,</li>\n  <li>in scintillating beauty to the sight</li>\n  <li>of all who gaze upon it; — so the threads,</li>\n  <li>inwoven, mingled in a thousand tints,</li>\n  <li>harmonious and contrasting; shot with gold:</li>\n  <li>and there, depicted in those shining webs,</li>\n  <li>were shown the histories of ancient days:—</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\"><mark>Minerva</mark> worked the Athenian Hill of Mars,</li>\n  <li>where ancient Cecrops built his citadel,</li>\n  <li>and showed the old contention for the name</li>\n  <li>it should be given.—Twelve celestial Gods</li>\n  <li>surrounded Jupiter, on lofty thrones;</li>\n  <li>and all their features were so nicely drawn,</li>\n  <li>that each could be distinguished.—Jupiter</li>\n  <li>appeared as monarch of those judging Gods.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">There Neptune, guardian of the sea, was shown</li>\n  <li>contending with <mark>Minerva</mark>. As he struck</li>\n  <li>the Rock with his long trident, a wild horse</li>\n  <li>sprang forth which he bequeathed to man. He claimed</li>\n  <li>his right to name the city for that gift.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And then she wove a portrait of herself,</li>\n  <li>bearing a shield, and in her hand a lance,</li>\n  <li>sharp-pointed, and a helmet on her head—</li>\n  <li>her breast well-guarded by her Aegis: there</li>\n  <li>she struck her spear into the fertile earth,</li>\n  <li>from which a branch of olive seemed to sprout,</li>\n  <li>pale with new clustered fruits.—And those twelve Gods,</li>\n  <li>appeared to judge, that olive as a gift</li>\n  <li>surpassed the horse which Neptune gave to man.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And, so <mark>Arachne</mark>, rival of her fame,</li>\n  <li>might learn the folly of her mad attempt,</li>\n  <li>from the great deeds of ancient histories,</li>\n  <li>and what award presumption must expect,</li>\n  <li><mark>Minerva</mark> wove four corners with life scenes</li>\n  <li>of contest, brightly colored, but of size</li>\n  <li value=\"86\">diminutive.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">In one of these was shown</li>\n  <li>the snow-clad mountains, Rhodope,</li>\n  <li>and Haemus, which for punishment were changed</li>\n  <li>from human beings to those rigid forms,</li>\n  <li>when they aspired to rival the high Gods.</li>\n  <li>And in another corner she described</li>\n  <li>that Pygmy, whom the angry Juno changed</li>\n  <li>from queen-ship to a crane; because she thought</li>\n  <li>herself an equal of the living Gods,</li>\n  <li>she was commanded to wage cruel wars</li>\n  <li>upon her former subjects. In the third,</li>\n  <li>she wove the story of Antigone,</li>\n  <li>who dared compare herself to Juno, queen</li>\n  <li>of Jupiter, and showed her as she was</li>\n  <li>transformed into a silly chattering stork,</li>\n  <li>that praised her beauty, with her ugly beak.—</li>\n  <li>Despite the powers of Ilion and her sire</li>\n  <li>Laomedon, her shoulders fledged white wings.</li>\n  <li>And so, the third part finished, there was left</li>\n  <li>one corner, where <mark>Minerva</mark> deftly worked</li>\n  <li>the story of the father, Cinyras;—</li>\n  <li>as he was weeping on the temple steps,</li>\n  <li>which once had been his daughter's living limbs.</li>\n  <li>And she adorned the border with designs</li>\n  <li>of peaceful olive—her devoted tree—</li>\n  <li>which having shown, she made an end of work.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">Arachne, of Maeonia, wove, at first</li>\n  <li>the story of Europa, as the bull</li>\n  <li>deceived her, and so perfect was her art,</li>\n  <li>it seemed a real bull in real waves.</li>\n  <li>Europa seemed to look back towards the land</li>\n  <li>which she had left; and call in her alarm</li>\n  <li>to her companions—and as if she feared</li>\n  <li>the touch of dashing waters, to draw up</li>\n  <li>her timid feet, while she was sitting on</li>\n  <li>the bull's back.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And she wove Asteria seized</li>\n  <li>by the assaulting eagle; and beneath the swan's</li>\n  <li>white wings showed Leda lying by the stream:</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr, when</li>\n  <li>he sought the beautiful Antiope,</li>\n  <li>to whom was given twins; and how he seemed</li>\n  <li>Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena;</li>\n  <li>and how he courted lovely Danae</li>\n  <li>luring her as a gleaming shower of gold;</li>\n  <li>and poor Aegina, hidden in his flame,</li>\n  <li>jove as a shepherd with Mnemosyne;</li>\n  <li>and beautiful Proserpina, involved</li>\n  <li>by him, apparent as a spotted snake.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And in her web, Arachne wove the scenes</li>\n  <li>of Neptune:—who was shown first as a bull,</li>\n  <li>when he was deep in love with virgin Arne</li>\n  <li>then as Enipeus when the giant twins,</li>\n  <li>Aloidae, were begot; and as the ram</li>\n  <li>that gambolled with Bisaltis; as a horse</li>\n  <li>loved by the fruitful Ceres, golden haired,</li>\n  <li>all-bounteous mother of the yellow grain;</li>\n  <li>and as the bird that hovered round snake-haired</li>\n  <li>Medusa, mother of the winged horse;</li>\n  <li>and as the dolphin, sporting with the Nymph,</li>\n  <li>Melantho.—All of these were woven true</li>\n  <li>to life, in proper shades.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And there she showed</li>\n  <li>Apollo, when disguised in various forms:</li>\n  <li>as when he seemed a rustic; and as when</li>\n  <li>he wore hawk-wings, and then the tawny skin</li>\n  <li>of a great lion; and once more when he</li>\n  <li>deluded Isse, as a shepherd lad.</li>\n  <li>And there was Bacchus, when he was disguised</li>\n  <li>as a large cluster of fictitious grapes;</li>\n  <li>deluding by that wile the beautiful</li>\n  <li>Erigone;—and Saturn, as a steed,</li>\n  <li>begetter of the dual-natured Chiron.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">And then Arachne, to complete her work,</li>\n  <li>wove all around the web a patterned edge</li>\n  <li>of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\"><mark>Minerva</mark> could not find a fleck or flaw—</li>\n  <li>even Envy can not censure perfect art—</li>\n  <li>enraged because Arachne had such skill</li>\n  <li>she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes</li>\n  <li>that showed those wicked actions of the Gods;</li>\n  <li>and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand,</li>\n  <li>struck the unhappy mortal on her head,—</li>\n  <li>struck sharply thrice, and even once again.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">Arachne's spirit, deigning not to brook</li>\n  <li>such insult, brooded on it, till she tied</li>\n  <li>a cord around her neck, and hung herself.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\"><mark>Minerva</mark>, moved to pity at the sight,</li>\n  <li>sustained and saved her from that bitter death;</li>\n  <li>but, angry still, pronounced another doom:</li>\n  <li><p class=\"conversation\">“Although I grant you life, most wicked one,</p></li>\n  <li><p class=\"conversation\">your fate shall be to dangle on a cord,</p></li>\n  <li><p class=\"conversation\">and your posterity forever shall</p></li>\n  <li><p class=\"conversation\">take your example, that your punishment</p></li>\n  <li><p class=\"conversation\">may last forever!”</p>Even as she spoke,</li>\n  <li>before withdrawing from her victim's sight,</li>\n  <li>she sprinkled her with juice—extract of herbs</li>\n  <li>of Hecate.</li>\n\n  <li class=\"top-space\">At once all hair fell off,</li>\n  <li>her nose and ears remained not, and her head</li>\n  <li>shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all</li>\n  <li>her body, leaving her diminutive.—</li>\n  <li>Her slender fingers gathered to her sides</li>\n  <li>as long thin legs;
