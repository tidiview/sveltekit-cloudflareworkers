painting of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jouvenet\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_JOUVENET\">Jean JOUVENET</a>, “<a

before an angel who, in an unbelievable atmosphere of spring, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemoi#Zephyrus\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemoi#Zephyrus\">Zephyrus</a>, winged man who represents the breeze of the west, presents a basket of garlands of flowers to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\">Flora</a>, goddess of this season.</p>\n<p>Documents establish that this painting was commissioned by king <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France\">Louis XIV</a> for this piece from a story that was made by the latin writer <a

the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar\">roman calendar</a>, introduces an original literary process: in his story, poet, he appeals to the gods, questioning himself as a master priest of calendar of the meaning of things and words.</p>\n<p>The text below comes from the 5th book and corresponds to the month of May: Ovid speaks directly to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\">Flora</a>.</p>\n<p>From <a

title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floralia\">Floralia</a> which took place in her honour by the end of April until early May.</p>\n<p>Although this is not directly related with the stage visually represented in the painting, this part allows to capture the mystery and charm of the goddess and the link with the representation given by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jouvenet\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_JOUVENET\">Jean JOUVENET</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(deity)\">Flora</a>
