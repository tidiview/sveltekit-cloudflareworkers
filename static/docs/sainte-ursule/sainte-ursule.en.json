and also made many menaces if they returned vainly to their lord.\nAnd then the king of Britain began to be much anxious, because that she that was ennobled in the faith of Jesu Christ should be wedded to him that adored idols, because that he wist well she would not consent in no manner, and also because he doubted much the cruelty of the king.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <picture><source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\" srcset=\"\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-280.webp 280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-380.webp 380w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-480.webp 480w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-640.webp 640w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule_700x395.webp 700w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-840.webp 840w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-1280.webp 1280w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img src=\"//docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule_700x395.jpg\" title=\"“Arrival at Koln”, “Arrival at Basel”, “Arrival at Rome”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\" alt=\"“Arrival at Koln”, “Arrival at Basel”, “Arrival at Rome”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\" class=\"class-diane-img\" width=\"700\" height=\"395\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\" srcset=\"\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-280.jpg 280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-380.jpg 380w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-480.jpg 480w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-640.jpg 640w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule_700x395.jpg 700w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-840.jpg 840w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule-1280.jpg 1280w\"></picture><figcaption>“Arrival at Koln”, “Arrival at Basel”, “Arrival at Rome”</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>And she, that was divinely inspired, did so much to her father that she consented to the marriage by such a condition, that for to solace her he should send to her father ten virgins, and to herself, and to those ten other virgins, he should send to each a thousand virgins, and should give to her space of three years for to dedicate her virginity, and the young man should be baptized, and in these three years he should be informed in the faith sufficiently, so that by wise counsel, and by virtue of the condition made, he should withdraw from her his courage.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <picture><source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\" srcset=\"\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-280.webp 280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-380.webp 380w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-480.webp 480w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-640.webp 640w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2_700x1071.webp 700w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-840.webp 840w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1280.webp 1280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1600.webp 1600w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1920.webp 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img src=\"//docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2_700x1071.jpg\" title=\"“St. Ursula, protectress”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\" alt=\"“St. Ursula, protectress”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\" class=\"class-40-img\" width=\"700\" height=\"1071\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\" srcset=\"\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-280.jpg 280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-380.jpg 380w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-480.jpg 480w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-640.jpg 640w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2_700x1071.jpg 700w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-840.jpg 840w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1280.jpg 1280w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1600.jpg 1600w,\n  /docs/sainte-ursule/sainte-ursule2-1920.jpg 1920w\"></picture><figcaption>“<abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Ursula, protectress”</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>But this youngling received this condition gladly, and hasted his father and was baptized and commanded all that Ursula had required should be done.\nAnd the father of the virgin ordained that his daughter, whom he most loved, and the others that had need of the comfort of men and service, ordained in their company good men for to serve them.</p>\n<p>Then virgins came from all parts, and men came for to see this great company, and many bishops came for to go with them in their pilgrimage, among whom was Pantulus, bishop of Basle, which went with them to Rome, and returned from thence with them and received martyrdom.\nS.
